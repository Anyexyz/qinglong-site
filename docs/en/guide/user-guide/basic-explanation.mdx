# Basic Explanation

## Built-in commands

- task

```bash
# Execute in sequence, if a random delay is set, it will be randomly delayed by a certain number of seconds
task <file_path>                                             
# Execute in sequence, regardless of whether a random delay is set, all run immediately, 
# and the foreground will output the day, while recorded in the log file
task <file_path> now                                         
# Concurrent execution, regardless of whether a random delay is set, are run immediately, 
# the foreground does not generate the day, directly recorded in the log file, and can be specified account execution
task <file_path> conc <env_name> <account_number>(Optional) 
# Specify the account to execute and run immediately regardless of whether a random delay is set 
task <file_path> desi <env_name> <account_number>       
# Set task timeout   
task -m <max_time> <file_path>
# Use -- to split, -- followed by a parameter that is passed to the script, as in the following example, the script receives the parameter -u whyour -p password
task <file_path> -- -u whyour -p password
```
