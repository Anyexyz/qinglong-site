## Environment Requirements

### Hardware Configuration

#### CPU

No special requirements. Our Docker image currently supports multiple platforms.

In theory, QL (QingLong) can run on any platform that supports Docker and Node.js.

#### Docker (Optional)

We mainly recommend running QL using Docker, as this can help avoid issues related to environment configuration. Refer to the documentation for more details:
