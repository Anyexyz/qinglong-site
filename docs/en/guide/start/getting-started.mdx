# Quick Start

## Deployment

### Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# curl -sSL get.docker.com | sh
docker run -dit \
  -v $PWD/ql/data:/ql/data \
  # The 5700 after the colon is the default port, if QlPort is set, it needs to be the same as QlPort.
  -p 5700:5700 \
  # Deployment paths are not required, e.g. /test.
  -e QlBaseUrl="/" \
  # Deployment port is not required, when using host mode, you can set the port after service startup, default 5700
  -e QlPort="5700" \
  --name qinglong \
  --hostname qinglong \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  whyour/qinglong:latest
```

### Docker-compose (Recommended)

```bash
# curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.16.1/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
mkdir qinglong
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whyour/qinglong/master/docker/docker-compose.yml

# start
docker-compose up -d
# stop
docker-compose down
```

### Podman (Recommended)

```bash
# https://podman.io/getting-started/installation
podman run -dit \
  --network bridge \
  -v $PWD/ql/data:/ql/data \
  # The 5700 after the colon is the default port, if QlPort is set, it needs to be the same as QlPort.
  -p 5700:5700 \
  # Deployment paths are not required, e.g. /test.
  -e QlBaseUrl="/" \
  # Deployment port is not required, when using host mode, you can set the port after service startup, default 5700
  -e QlPort="5700" \
  --name qinglong \
  --hostname qinglong \
  docker.io/whyour/qinglong:latest
```

### Local

It is recommended to use a pure system installation to avoid losing the original system data, you need to install node/npm/python3/pip3 yourself

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
# Centos
curl --silent --location https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo bash
```

```bash
npm install -g node-pre-gyp pnpm
npm install -g @whyour/qinglong
qinglong
# Add the environment variables QL_DIR and QL_DATA_DIR when prompted
export QL_DIR=""
export QL_DATA_DIR=""
# Run again
qinglong
```

## Built-in commands

- task

```bash
# Execute in sequence, if a random delay is set, it will be randomly delayed by a certain number of seconds
task <file_path>                                             
# Execute in sequence, regardless of whether a random delay is set, all run immediately, 
# and the foreground will output the day, while recorded in the log file
task <file_path> now                                         
# Concurrent execution, regardless of whether a random delay is set, are run immediately, 
# the foreground does not generate the day, directly recorded in the log file, and can be specified account execution
task <file_path> conc <env_name> <account_number>(Optional) 
# Specify the account to execute and run immediately regardless of whether a random delay is set 
task <file_path> desi <env_name> <account_number>       
# Set task timeout   
task -m <max_time> <file_path>
# Use -- to split, -- followed by a parameter that is passed to the script, as in the following example, the script receives the parameter -u whyour -p password
task <file_path> -- -u whyour -p password
```

- ql

```bash
# Update and restart Green Dragon
ql update                                                    
# Run custom scripts extra.sh
ql extra                                                     
# Adding a single script file
ql raw <file_url>                                             
# Add a specific script for a single repository
ql repo <repo_url> <whitelist> <blacklist> <dependence> <branch>   
# Delete old logs
ql rmlog <days>                                              
# Start bot
ql bot                                                       
# Detecting the Green Dragon environment and repairing it
ql check                                                     
# Reset the number of login errors
ql resetlet                                                  
# Disable two-step login

```
